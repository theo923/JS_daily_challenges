Challenge :three:: 

divisible is a function that accepts an array and returns all the values in that array which are divisible by three. Try using a higher order function (e.g. map, reduce...).

divisible([1, 2, 3, 4]); //expected: [3]
divisible([1, 3, 6, 13, 15]); //expected: [3, 6, 15]
divisible([21, 17, 12]); //expected: [21, 12]
