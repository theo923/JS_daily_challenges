Challenge :one: :six:

Write a function which finds and returns the unique elements from two arrays. Your function should accept two arrays and return an array with the elements which only occur once. If there are no unique elements, the function should return an empty array.

Example:

 uniqueElements([1, 2, 4, 4], [1, 3, 3])

should return 

[2]

and

uniqueElements([1, 10, 15, 24, 24], [1, 1, 24, 30])

should return

[10, 15, 30]
